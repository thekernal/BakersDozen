# BakersDozen

This is a game designed for the js13kGames coding competition for 2024. This years theme is Triskaidekaphobia or fear of the Number 13. In light of this I am designing a game called. Bakers Dozen. In medieval times Bakers would make 13 or more of something inorder to guarantee that they had a dozen good results and would toss the rest.

In Bakers Dozen the game. Bakers will cook through a 13 level tier of Pastries and Baked goods striving to successfully cook only 12 of each of them and becoming the "Ultimate Baker".

Baking a recipe consists of three phases. 

1. Preparation
  * Did you forget the Salt?
  * Did you stir it too little?
  * Did you stir it too much?
2. Oven Temperature
  * Is it consistent?
  * Is it too hot?
3. Cooking Time.
  * Too Little and it is raw
  * Too Much and it is burnt
  * Too Perfect and you cook all 13 successfully.

At the end of the three phases the number of edible baked goods is calculated. If you cook exactly 12 successfully you move on to the next tier. If you cook 13 you loose all that you cooked and start back at the first tier. If you cook less than 12 you go back to the first tier, However when you return to that layer again you will only attempt to cook the number of items that makes 13. So it you cooked 5 successfully on your first attempt your second attempt will only cook 8 (13 - 5).
